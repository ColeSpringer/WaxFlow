# ADR-0002: Public API surface, module layout, and stability policy

Status: Accepted (2026-07-02)

## Context

The codecs are meant to be imported by anyone (WaxBin and WaxTap included),
which demands a stable, dependency-free public tree. But codec APIs will
churn heavily through v0.x, and multi-module repos tax every change with
tagging ceremony.

## Decision

- **Public packages**: root facade, `waxerr`, `audio`, `dsp/...`,
  `codec/...`, `container/...`, `format`, `source`, `server`, `client`.
  Everything else lives under `internal/`.
- **The public tree is stdlib-only.** `make depcheck` runs `go list -deps`
  over the public packages and fails CI on any non-stdlib import. Runtime
  third-party dependencies are confined to `cmd/` and `internal/`
  (`spf13/cobra`; later `colespringer/waxlabel`).
- **Single module through v1.0.** External importers of, say,
  `waxflow/codec/flac` inherit cobra in their module *graph* (never their
  binaries); that is acceptable during v0.x churn.
- **Structural extraction at v1.0**: when codec APIs freeze, the stdlib-only
  tree graduates to a nested module with an empty `require` block, so the
  guarantee becomes structural instead of script-enforced.
- **No compatibility promise before v1.0.0.** Tagged v0.x releases are
  usable snapshots, not contracts. At v1.0.0 every exported identifier in
  the public tree is semver-locked, preceded by a strict surface audit.
- Unfinished codecs compile and test but stay **unregistered** in `format`
  and `/caps`; the service never advertises what it cannot do.

## Consequences

- `depcheck`'s package list grows as public packages land; forgetting to add a
  new public package there is the main failure mode, so the Makefile derives
  the list from a single variable reviewed in PRs.
- `resolver/` is the one intentional nested module planned before v1.0,
  keeping `modernc.org/sqlite` out of the main module graph.

## Amendment (2026-07-11, M19): the extraction as implemented

The v1.0 structural extraction landed inverted from the original
wording, with the same guarantee: instead of the stdlib-only tree
moving into a nested module (which would have changed every published
import path), the tree stayed at the module root and everything
carrying dependencies moved out. The root module's `require` block is
now empty, so importing any public package pulls in nothing, by
construction rather than by CI script (`depcheck` stays as the fast
pre-push guard).

- `cli/` (nested module): the cobra command tree, the waxlabel-backed
  metadata mapper (`cli/label`), and the stock binary
  (`cli/cmd/waxflow`). Its packages exist to build the binary and the
  resolver flavor; they carry no independent stability promise.
- `resolver/` (nested module, pre-existing): the WaxBin flavor, now
  requiring `waxflow/cli` for the shared command tree.
- `oracletest/` (nested module, test-only): the tests whose oracles are
  third-party modules (waxlabel metadata round trips, the go-mp3
  differential, the m4b chapter golden, the jobs e2e). The M17
  precedent (nested modules keep gated integration suites out of `go
  test ./...`) applied to test dependencies; `make test-oracle` and a
  dedicated CI step run it.
- The v1.0 surface audit also added `context.Context` to
  `source.Resolver.Resolve` (the recorded M17 limitation): catalog
  lookups now observe request cancellation, bounded by the resolver's
  own query timeout and still aborted by Close.

Internal packages (`internal/...`) remain in the root module and are
reachable by the nested modules through Go's path-prefix internal rule;
they add no dependencies (the root go.mod stays empty), and their
instability is contained by the replace-pinned, same-repo builds.
